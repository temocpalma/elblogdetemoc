### Widgets

* All in flutter is a widget
* Apps are made up of a widget tree
* Exists two widget types:
   - Stateless: are immutable, meaning that their properties canâ€™t change
   - Stateful: allow user interaction, it can change its state and therefore its appearance
___

### Stateful Widgets

* Requires at least two classes:
   - StatefulWidget class: only create the state
   ```
   class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
      @override
      MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => MyStatefulWidgetState();
   }
   ```
   - State class: contains all state logic
   ```
   class MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
      ...
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
         ...
      }
      ...
   }
   ```

   - *main.dart* is the main class
* *pubspec.yaml:* manages the assets and dependencies
